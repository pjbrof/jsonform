# JSON Form

A simple utility for creating a flat JSON structure of string types.

The goal is to create a simple and easy to use JSON form without a ton of robust features that lose the usability aspect of the form.

## Future Enhancements

- Nesting
- Types (Bool, Int)
- Drag to Reorder
- Live Preview
- Validation
- Browser Support Fallbacks
